authors, products, 4dim, Odiya provided by the instructor. It was part of ADV. NLP course. 
The details are discussed in the attached pdf. I could not upload the data set because of Copyright.

Note: This is not the usual README file to instruct how to use the code. 
I prepared these files shortly before the deadline, and I assumed the goal is to show some actual code. 
Moreover, since I could not upload the data sets, I know it is not practical to actually run these codes. 
However, the resultsÂ are all documented in the report file.
