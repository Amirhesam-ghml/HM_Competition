This work was motivated by Facebook Hateful Memes Competition. This was a joint work of me and another student Tianjian Huang. However, all the results in the report have been implemented by me. The code is based on Facebook MMF frame work. I built upon their code. More details about goals and implementation can be found in the report file.
