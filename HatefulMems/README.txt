This work was motivated by Facebook Hateful Memes Competition. This was a joint work of me and another student Tianjian Huang.
However, all the results in the report have been implemented by me. The code is based on Facebook MMF frame work. 
I built upon their code. More details about goals and implementation can be found in the report file. 

Note: This is not the usual README file to instruct how to use the code. 
I prepared these files shortly before the deadline, and I assumed the goal is to show some actual code. 
Moreover, since I could not upload the data sets, I know it is not practical to actually run these codes. 
However, the resultsÂ are all documented in the report file.
